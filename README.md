# RiskBoardGame
An implementation of Risk driven by an adjacency matrix two dimensional array

Run the main class to play the game.
The AdjacencyMatrix class includes the guts of the game setup, and how all the countries are connected. An adjacency matrix is better than an adjacency list considering the nodes connections ratio.

Made with Test Driven Development, up to 4 users can play, and bells and whistles like changing colors based on each players turn.


Changes to make: implement GUI and an option to play with the board, not just in the console.
