# RiskBoardGame
An implementation of Risk driven by an adjacency matrix two dimensional array

Run the main class to play the game.

Made with Test Driven Development, up to 4 users can play, and bells and whistles like changing colors based on each players turn.


Changes to make: implement GUI and an option to play with the board, not just in the console.
